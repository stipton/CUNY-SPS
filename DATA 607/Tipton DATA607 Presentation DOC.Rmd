## Long, long ago....

Recall the question Zack Dravis left us with at the end of his presentation on KNN (K numbered neighbors):

*"How to measure success [of the knn model]?"*

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
set.seed(1234)

HumanHeight <- rnorm(200, mean = 5.5, sd = .5)
WookieHeight <- rnorm(200, mean = 7.0, sd = .75)
EwokHeight <- rnorm(200, mean = 4, sd = .5)

HumanWeight <- rnorm(200, mean = 150, sd = 30)
WookieWeight <- rnorm(200, mean = 200, sd = 50)
EwokWeight <- rnorm(200, mean = 125, sd = 30)

SWSpecies <- data.frame(Species = c(rep("Human", 200), rep("Wookie", 200), rep("Ewok", 200)), Height = c(HumanHeight, WookieHeight, EwokHeight), Weight = c(HumanWeight, WookieWeight, EwokWeight))

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

#Split into training and test
TrainingData <- SWSpecies %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  slice(1:133) %>%
  ungroup()

TestData <- SWSpecies %>%
  group_by(Species) %>%
  slice(134:200) %>%
  ungroup()

library(class)


library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
```

## Summarize Zach's project

## Running the process with two different $k$ values

```{r}
SpeciesPrediction <- knn(train = select(TrainingData, Height, Weight), 
                         test = select(TestData, Height, Weight), 
                         cl = TrainingData$Species, 
                         k = 3)
FirstTest <- cbind(TestData, SpeciesPrediction)
FirstTest %>%  kable("html", caption = "k = 3") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

```{r}
SpeciesPrediction <- knn(train = select(TrainingData, Height, Weight), 
                         test = select(TestData, Height, Weight), 
                         cl = TrainingData$Species, 
                         k = 9)
FirstTest <- cbind(TestData, SpeciesPrediction)
FirstTest %>%  kable("html", caption = "k = 9") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped"), full_width = FALSE) %>%
  scroll_box(height = "500px")
```

## Simple accuracy

* calculate from Zach
* sufficient (book quote)

## Confusion Matrix

* Describe boxes
* Describe overall statistics (Accuraty and Error)
* Describe other statistics

* Wikipedia example
* Calculate from Zach
